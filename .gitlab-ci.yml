# GitLab CI DISABLED - Switched to GitHub Actions for CI/CD
# 
# Reason: Conserving GitLab compute credits
# Alternative: GitHub Actions workflow active at .github/workflows/ci.yml
#
# To re-enable GitLab CI:
# 1. Rename .gitlab-ci.yml.disabled back to .gitlab-ci.yml 
# 2. Remove this file
# 3. Ensure GitLab compute credits are available
#
# Current CI/CD Status:
# ‚úÖ GitHub Actions: Active (free tier)
# ‚ùå GitLab CI: Disabled (credit conservation)
# üöß AWS ECS: Prepared but not deployed

# This empty file prevents GitLab from running any CI/CD pipelines
# while preserving the repository structure
